## Data Format

The structure of a sample synset is as follows:

	<SYNSET>
		<ID>TUR10-0038510</ID>
		<LITERAL>anne<SENSE>2</SENSE>
		</LITERAL>
		<POS>n</POS>
		<DEF>...</DEF>
		<EXAMPLE>...</EXAMPLE>
	</SYNSET>

Each entry in the dictionary is enclosed by <SYNSET> and </SYNSET> tags. Synset members are represented as literals and their sense numbers. <ID> shows the unique identifier given to the synset. <POS> and <DEF> tags denote part of speech and definition, respectively. As for the <EXAMPLE> tag, it gives a sample sentence for the synset.
